authentication documentation.</a> The available authentication options are described in the table below.<br/>
Where the details below refer to the scope of the request, the possible options are:
<ul>
  <li>userInWebsite - default. Returns the user's records which have been input into this specific website.</li>
  <li>user - returns the user's records input into any website.</li>
  <li>reporting - returns records where the source website has elected to share its data to the authenticated
  website for reporting purposes.</li>
  <li>verification - returns records where the source website has elected to share its data to the authenticated
  website for verification purposes.</li>
  <li>data_flow - returns records where the source website has elected to share its data to the authenticated

<p>When calling any of the endpoints to GET a list of entities, you can include
parameters in a query string to limit the response. You can filter on any of
the fields in the entity. Only filtering on equality is supported. E.g. to list
all public locations with a location_type_id of 123, use</p>
<pre>services/rest/locations?public=true&location_type_id=123</pre>
<p>(NB. the list of location types is in a term list with title 'Location

$lang['submissionFormatText'] = <<<HTML
<p>In order to POST data to insert, or PUT data to submit, values must be provided in the correct
structure. Fields and their values must be provided inside a `values` property and attribute values
can be included by creating a field called "locAttr:n", "smpAttr:n" or "occAttr:n" for samples,
occurrences and location data respectively, where <em>n</em> is the attribute ID. This is
illustrated in the following simple sample record submission:</p>
<pre><code>
POST /index.php/services/rest/samples
{
  "values": {
    "survey_id": 1,
    "entered_sref": "SU1234",
    "entered_sref_system": "OSGB",
    "date": "01\/08\/2020",
    "smpAttr:4": 14
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Nested records (where there is a one to many relationship) are provided by naming the entity
in a property alongside the values array, then listing the child records in an array beneath.
Nested records can contain multiple levels of nesting.</p>
<pre><code>
POST /index.php/services/rest/samples
{
  "values": {
    "survey_id": 1,
    "entered_sref": "SU1234",
    "entered_sref_system": "OSGB",
    "date": "01\/08\/2020"
  },
  "occurrences": [
    {
      "values": {
        "taxa_taxon_list_id": 2,
        "occAttr:8": "4 adults",
      }
    },
    {
      "values": {
        "taxa_taxon_list_id": 2,
        "occAttr:8": "1 juvenile",
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>In some cases, a many-to-one relationship can be included in the submission. In these cases, the
nested entity is described using the singular form of the entity name and there is no need to
wrap the child object in an array (as only one is possible). The nested object's primary key is
then saved into the current record as a foreign key.</p>

    the token is issued on behalf of the website rather than a specific user.</li>
    <li>scope - Optional scopes available for requests made using this token. Multiple scopes can be specified
    separated by a space in which case the scope used by a request can be specified in a URL parameter called "scope".
    Each scope defines the list of websites which make their data available to this request as well as the user filter.
    If multiple scopes are claimed by a token, then a request can provide `scope=<scope name>` in the URL parameters to
    select the active scope for a request. Default is "userInWebsite", or "reporting" if the

Endpoint which allows media files such as record photos to be cached on the server prior to submitting the associated

uploads.
TXT;
$lang['resources']['POST media-queue'] = <<<TXT
Adds a media file such as a photo to the queue of media files available to attach to a subsequent submission. Several
files can be sent in each request but note that server limits on submission size will limit the number possible. Files
can be named with a single field name or an array field name with '[]' appended. The response will be an array, where
each item provides the `name` of the stored file and the `tempPath` where the file is located. For example:
<pre><code>
POST /index.php/services/rest/media-queue
myfirstfile=IMAGE FILE
mysecondfile=IMAGE FILE

Response:
{
  "myfirstfile": {
    "name": "5f3698a2e587b1.59610000.png",
    "tempPath": "http://localhost/warehouse-test/upload-queue/5f3698a2e587b1.59610000.png"
  },
  "mysecondfile": {
    "name": "5f3698a2e587c1.59610000.png",
    "tempPath": "http://localhost/warehouse-test/upload-queue/5f3698a2e587c1.59610000.png"
  }
}
</pre></code>

Or:
<pre><code>
POST /index.php/services/rest/media-queue
myfile[]=IMAGE FILE
myfile[]=IMAGE FILE

Response:
{
  "file[0]": {
    "name": "18/60/23/5f3698a2e587b1.59610000.png",
    "tempPath": "http://localhost/warehouse-test/upload-queue/5f3698a2e587b1.59610000.png"

  "file[1]": {
    "name": "18/60/23/5f3698a2e587c1.59610000.png",
    "tempPath": "http://localhost/warehouse-test/upload-queue/5f3698a2e587c1.59610000.png"
  }
}
</pre></code>

The client must store the name of each queued entry then include that in the subsequent submission when the record data
are posted. For example:
<pre><code>
POST /index.php/services/rest/samples
{
  "values": {
    "survey_id": 1,
    "entered_sref": "SU1234",
    "entered_sref_system": "OSGB",
    "date": "01\/08\/2020"
  },
  "media": [
    {
      "values": {
        "queued": "18/60/23/5f3698a2e587b1.59610000.png",
        "caption": "Sample image"
      },
    },
    {
      "values": {
        "queued": "18/60/23/5f3698a2e587c1.59610000.png",
        "caption": "2nd sample image"
      }
    }
  ]
}
</pre></code>

Note that queued items will be stored for at least 1 day and attempts to submit record data referring to queued items
that have expired will result in an error. Therefore if a pending submission is stored on the client for more than one
day the media should be re-posted to /media-queue before sending the submission.
