/**
 * Verifier notifications config.
 *
 * The following configuration should hold the list of websites which host a
 * verification portal and where the verifiers should be automatically
 * notified of incoming records. Each entry consists of:
 * * website_id - the website that the records are being shared to for
 *   verification or moderation.
 * * title - name of the website used in the notification text
 * * url -n the verification page URL path.
 * * linkText - optional, override the default text in the link to the page.
 * * extraParams - additional filter parameters (from the standard parameters
 *   list) to supply to the report which detects records to notify for. In this
 *   example, a website is excluded from the verification page. Optional.
