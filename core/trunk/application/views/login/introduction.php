<p>Indicia is a toolkit that simplifies the construction of new websites which allow data entry, mapping and reporting of wildlife records. Indicia
is an Open Source project funded by the Open Air Laboratories Network (of which the NBN is a partner) and managed by the 
Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.</p>
<p>This is the Indicia Warehouse system, providing administration and configuration of websites built using Indicia. In order to gain access to this Indicia system you must log on. If you do not have an account and need one, please contact the administrator <?php echo $admin_contact; ?> who can create one for you.</p>
